# Cheatsheet

The cheatsheet is a Jupyter Notebook file with the `.ipynb` extension. The cheatsheet is a collection of code snippets and explanations.

The cheatsheet is divided into sections and sub-sections. Each section contains a collection of related code snippets. The sections are organized in a way that the most frequently used code snippets are at the top.
